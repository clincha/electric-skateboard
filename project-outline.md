# Project Outline: Skateboard Vibration Mapping

As a skateboarder, I enjoy riding all around town. However, I have observed that the quality of roads can significantly affect the skating experience, with some roads being more suitable and safer than others. When riding a skateboard, steering is achieved by leaning in one direction or another. This is manageable at low speeds, but at higher speeds, it can lead to a phenomenon called "speed wobble," which poses a considerable risk of falling off the board. Bumpy roads increase the likelihood of experiencing speed wobbles even at lower speeds.

Another hazard posed by uneven road surfaces is the intense vibration that can loosen the rider's grip on the board. Since I am not physically attached to the board while skating, gravity is the only force keeping me in place. Heavy vibrations may cause me to lose my balance, potentially resulting in a fall.

To address this issue, I aim to create a map of the roads I frequently skate on, indicating the level of vibration experienced on each surface. This way, I can identify the roads with the highest vibration levels and avoid them, thereby improving the safety of my skating sessions.

## Navigation System Integration

To accurately map the roads and their respective vibration levels, I plan to integrate a navigation system into this project. By utilizing GPS technology, I can track my exact location while skating and record the associated vibrations experienced on each road segment. This precise data collection will help create an informative map that displays the vibration levels of various roads throughout the town.

## Data Sharing with Local Council

The collected data on road quality and vibration levels can also be beneficial for the local council. By sharing this information, the council can gain valuable insights into which roads require maintenance to ensure a safer and smoother experience for skateboarders and other road users. This collaboration can potentially lead to improvements in road conditions, benefiting not only skateboarders but also cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers in the community.

## Key Technical Challenges

When developing the skateboard vibration mapping project, several technical challenges need to be addressed to ensure the successful implementation of the system:

1. **Limited space on the skateboard**: The compact nature of a skateboard means that there is minimal space available for integrating additional components, such as the GPS module and vibration sensors. Designing an efficient and compact system that does not obstruct the rider or impede the board's performance is crucial.

2. **Avoiding interference with electric skateboard electronics**: As the project involves integration with an electric skateboard, it is essential to prevent any interference with the existing electronics that control the board's speed and operation. Any unintended interference could lead to performance issues or even pose a danger to the rider.

3. **Minimizing added weight**: To maintain the skateboard's performance and maneuverability, it is important to minimize the weight of the additional components used in this project. Adding significant weight to the board could affect its speed, handling, and overall efficiency, ultimately compromising the user's skating experience.

Addressing these technical challenges will be vital in ensuring the successful development and deployment of a reliable and effective skateboard vibration mapping system.
